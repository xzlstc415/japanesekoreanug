  <h1>About JapaneseKoreanUG</h1>
  <p>JapaneseKoreanUG is produced by (<a href="https://twitter.com/jpkr_ug">jpkr_ug</a> on Twitter and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPLVTmdgB-ljT3S5xGBhBQA">JapaneseKoreanUG</a> on Youtube). Free streaming replay and tutorial videos will be released asap after the streaming day featuring hightlight and tricks with <a href="http://jp.leagueoflegends.com/">League of Legend</a>. The tutorials are short and focus on one technique so you can quickly move on to applying it to your own game. The topics target the intermediate LOL player, but beginners and experts will get something out of it as well. A Pro option is going to be released soon in the near future.</p>
